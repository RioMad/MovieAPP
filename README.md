Hello Team,
Hope you are doing well.

* TMDP API: The API key is already embedded in the root file.
* Dependencies: No third-party dependencies have been added.
* Build/Run: The project can be built and run using any Apple ID through Xcode.
* Implemented Features: All features have been implemented as per the given criteria.
* Known Limitations:

  * Favorites: The table view favorites feature is implemented, but enabling it may affect the `didSelect` scenario (note: the feature is implemented but currently hidden).
  *  Video Stream: A custom video player has been added. However, since the API returns multiple playlists, the implementation was changed to use YouTube streaming instead. The custom player file is still included in the repository.
